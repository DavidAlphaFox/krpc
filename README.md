### Synopsis

KRPC is simple remote procedure call mechanism used by bittorrent DHT
but might be used anywhere else.

### Description

KRPC basically consisting of bencoded dictionaries sent over UDP. This
implementation provides extra safiety by separation of procedure
signature | implementation and baking procedure type in host
language, thus it's hard to shoot yourself in the foot accidently.

See bittorrent DHT [specification][spec] for detailed protocol
description.

### Modules

* Remote.KRPC — simple interface which reduce all RPC related stuff to
  a few lines. Should be used in the first place.

* Remote.KRPC.Protocol — raw protocol implementation.
* Remote.KRPC.Scheme — message validation.

### Documentation

For usage see examples in ```examples``` directory.
